# Network Hardening Report

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed network hardening report designed to address vulnerabilities within a social media organization's network infrastructure. Following a recent data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, the report provides a security risk assessment and outlines best practices to mitigate future risks.

## Key Vulnerabilities Addressed
The network security assessment identified four primary vulnerabilities:
1. Employees sharing passwords.
2. Admin passwords set to default.
3. No firewall traffic filtering rules.
4. Lack of Multifactor Authentication (MFA).

## Hardening Tools and Methods Implemented
To address these vulnerabilities, the following hardening methods are recommended:
1. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** Adding an additional layer of security by requiring users to authenticate with multiple factors.
2. **Firewall Configuration:** Creating and updating firewall rules to filter traffic and prevent unauthorized access to the network.
3. **Password Policy Enforcement & Password Manager:** Establishing a strong password policy and encouraging the use of password managers to store complex passwords securely.

## Why These Solutions?
- **MFA** significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even when passwords are compromised.
- **Firewall Configuration** ensures control over incoming and outgoing network traffic, providing a barrier against malicious access.
- **Password Policy Enforcement** reduces the likelihood of credential-based attacks and encourages stronger, more secure passwords.

## Conclusion
By implementing these network hardening techniques, the organization will minimize its exposure to security risks, ensuring a safer environment for sensitive data. These methods will help prevent future breaches and strengthen overall network security.
